## Analizing Given Files:
Analyzing the given files we can understand that:
- [**Setup.sol**](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Setup.sol), as the name suggest, is a contract that setup the blockchain environment interacting with the Iterator.sol contract and creating a new Iterator contract transferring it a value of 30 Ether.  
- [**Iterator.sol**](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol) is a contract with some functions that permit to donate and withdraw ethers from and to that contract and also check the balance of an address. Analyzing its code we can find out that its [withdraw](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol#L20-L31) function is vulnerable to a **Re-Entrancy Attack**: the variable _balances_ isn't safety updated in the [withdraw](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol#L20-L31) function, so it's possible to call [withdraw](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol#L20-L31) multiple times before it finishes executing. 

## Re-Entrancy Attack
This type of attack consist of calling recursively a vulnerable function that didn't check it's own state. 
This attack was the hearth of [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)) Hack, an hacking attack that happened in June 2016 and drained the funds of the largest smart contract of that time, that held more than 150 million dollars in Ether. A more detailed description of the history of the DAO's hack can be found [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-history-of-the-dao-hack).

## Exploit Creation
To perform this kind of attack we need to create a new contract, [**Reentrancy.sol**](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Reentrancy.sol), in which we write the exploit.
The contract must first call the existing [Iterator.sol](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol) contract:
```solidity
Iterator public iterator;

constructor(address payable etherIteratorAddress) public {
    iterator = Iterator(etherIteratorAddress);
}
```

The heart of the exploit is the function [attack](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Reentrancy.sol#L22-L26): 
```solidity
function attack() external payable {
    require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
    iterator.donate.value(1 ether)(address(this)); 
    iterator.withdraw(1 ether);
} 
```
The attack function, because of the lack of state variables or function modifiers in the [withdraw](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Iterator.sol#L20-L31) function of Iterator.sol, was able to call iterator.withdraw() multiple times before it finished executing. This resulted in more refunds and essentially recovering all the Ether in the contract.

## Transaction Sending
After the creation of [Reentrancy.sol](Writeups/XMASCTF2021/残響/Reentrancy.sol), we can connect to the blockchain given by the challenge with the rpc endpoint given through `nc challs.xmas.htsp.ro 8014`, after selecting _launch new instance_. With that command we also receive the Setup contract address and an uuid that will then be necessary to get the flag.
To connect to the blockchain provided we can use a web-based IDE, [**Remix**](http://remix.ethereum.org), that provides the possibility to connect to an external blockchain. The connection and contract development in the external blockchain can also be done also with the [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) python library.<br />
With Remix IDE all we have to do is: open the _File Explorer_ tab and upload the three contracts, then go to the _Solidity Compiler_ tab and compile the three contracts by selecting the correct version of solidity (in this case 0.6.0) and finally deploy the contracts by going to the _Deploy and Run Transactions_ tab. <br /> <br />
To deploy the contracts we must first connect to the external blockchain of the challenge, to do this we have to change the Remix [environment](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#run-setup) to _Web3 Provider_ (that enables the connection to a remote node) and insert the rpc endpoint link given. 
Then we insert the address of the Setup.sol contract in _Load Contract from Address_ and by clicking on _At Address_ we will load the contract in the address given. We could then see the contract loaded in the _Deployed Contracts_ section with the respective callable functions.
To call a function of a contract in Remix IDE it's needed to go to the _Deployed Contracts_ selection and click on the button named as the function. <br />
By calling the Setup.iterator() function we can obtain the address of the Iterator.sol contract. We then deploy the Reentrancy.sol contract by selecting it and giving the Iterator contract address as a parameter.
Finally by calling the Reentrancy.attack() function, which requests to receive an ether since it is a payable function and we have set `require (msg.value> = 1 ether);`, we can empty the Iterator.sol contract of the 30 ethers that originally contained (see `address (iterator) .transfer (30 ether);` from Setup.sol). <br />
Now by calling the Setup.isSolved() function, which checks if the balance of the Iterator.sol contract is equal to zero, we get a value of true. 


## Getting the flag
Finally, after the function Setup.isSolved() returned true, we can get the flag by connecting to `nc challs.xmas.htsp.ro 8014`, selecting _get flag_ and inserting our _uuid_.

Turns out that the flag was:
`X-MAS{Th1s_goes_0n_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on_and_on}`
